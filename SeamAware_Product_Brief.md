# SeamAware™ Product Brief

**Tagline**: *Visualizing the Invisible Seams of Fluid Topology.*

## 1. Vision Statement
SeamAware™ is a computational engine and visualization platform designed to detect and expose topological non-orientability in dynamic systems. While conventional CFD tools focus on energy and vorticity, SeamAware™ focuses on **Parity Stability**—identifying the "seams" where global orientation flips.

## 2. Core Features (The Engine)
- **Topological Frame Parity ($w_1$)**: A proprietary diagnostic that distinguishes between geometric twist and topological non-orientability.
- **Multimanifold Support**: Native support for Möbius, Cylinder, and Klein Bottle embeddings.
- **Intuitive Visual Language**: Time-gradient trajectory mapping (Turbo colorscale) for instant flow-direction perception.
- **3D Embedding Discovery**: A research track for finding "Local Non-Orientability" in global 3D flows (Hopf Fibration, DNA Vortices).

## 3. The Interactive Showcase (The Website)
SeamAware.com will host an interactive laboratory where users can:
- **Compare Geometries**: Live side-by-side particle integration on Möbius vs. Cylinder.
- **Explore Vector Fields**: Interactive 3D hover-states to inspect Tangent, Normal, and Binormal vectors.
- **Analyze Signatures**: Real-time plots of $\delta(t)$ (drift) and $w_1(t)$ (parity).

## 4. Market & Licensing
- **Research Plugin**: Integrate with OpenFOAM or ANSYS to provide topological diagnostics.
- **Educational Suite**: A "Topological Sandbox" for graduate-level geometry and physics courses.
- **API Access**: A cloud-based compute API (powered by Antigravity) to process trajectory data and return topological signatures.

## 5. Roadmap
- **Q1 2026**: Interactive Web-Alpha (Plotly integration).
- **Q2 2026**: "The Knotted Vortex" Beta (Support for Trefoil and Linked Ring flows).
- **Q3 2026**: SeamAware SDK for Unity/Unreal Engine.
